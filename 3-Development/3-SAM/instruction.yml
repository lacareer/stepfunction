# MAKE SURE AWS SAM IS INSTALL ON YOUR MACHINE
# Check if it is installed: 
    sam --version
 

# Create an AWS SAM project
# Use AWS SAM to deploy an API Gateway REST API with a Synchronous Express State Machine backend integration
# Test the API

Below are the instruction

mkdir stepfunctions-rest-api-sam

cd stepfunctions-rest-api-sam

touch template.yaml api.yaml hello_world.asl.json

# Copy each respective contents to template.yaml api.yaml hello_world.asl.json files

sam build
sam deploy --guided

Open the Amazon API Gateway console  and sign in.
Choose your REST API named, SAMStepFunctionsRestApi.
In the Resources pane, you can select the method you want to test. Click on the POST method.

In the Method Execution pane, in the Client box, choose TEST.
Copy/paste the JSON below into the Request Body field:

{
"key": "Hello Step Functions!"
}


Click Test. The following information will be displayed:
Request is the resource's path that was called for the method.
Status is the response's HTTP status code.
Latency is the time between the receipt of the request from the caller and the returned response.
Response Body is the HTTP response body.
Response Headers are the HTTP response headers.
Logs are the simulated Amazon CloudWatch Logs entries that would have been written if this method were called outside of the API Gateway console.


The Response Body output should be:
  "Hello back to you!"


Test the deployed API using cURL:
Open a new terminal window in your AWS Cloud9 environment.
Copy the following cURL command and paste it into the terminal window, 
replacing <api-id> with your API's API ID and <region> with the region where your API is deployed. 
You may have copied this URL in from the CloudFormation output in the last step. 
You can also find the full invoke URL in the API Gateway console by navigating to Stages > dev.

    curl -X POST\
    'https://<api-id>.execute-api.<region>.amazonaws.com/dev' \
    -d '{"key":"Hello Step Functions"}' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
