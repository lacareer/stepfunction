# First deploy the stack and then do the below;
# You have to practice this workshop module using workflow studio to see how SF created 
# Now jump to the "Step A"

# or

# Copy the SF code generated above
# Modify the given template (Note that the SF code generated using Workflow studio and added to the template)
# Delete the stack created above and re-create it using the new template
# Jump to "Step A"

# To integrate API with SF do the following:
